LinkLog

Linksys log viewing utility

## Features

* Capture packets from Linksys routers (and possibly others) that send
  SNMP log information to a defined host.

* Unix-style command line tool with many configurable options.

* Define filters to restrict network traffic displayed based on the
  host name, IP address, protocol, and destination.

* Redfinable template based output to allow customizing the program's
  display format.

* Support for running as a non-privileged user via port forwarding
  (which still requires root to configure initially.)

* No dependencies beyond Perl and its core modules, so this should
  work on any operating system that supports Perl. Tested on Linux and
  Windows with Cygwin.
